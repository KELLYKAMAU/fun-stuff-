# 🎵 How to Add Your Romantic Music

## Quick Setup

1. **Find Your Romantic Music**
   - Visit [Pixabay Music](https://pixabay.com/music/search/romantic/) - Free romantic music
   - Visit [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/romantic) - Beautiful romantic tracks
   - Or use your own MP3 file

2. **Get the Direct MP3 Link**
   - For Pixabay: Click on a song → Click "Free Download" → Copy the direct MP3 URL
   - For Bensound: Download the song and upload to a hosting service (GitHub, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Or upload your own MP3 to a file hosting service

3. **Update the Music URL**
   - Open `script.js`
   - Find line 13: `musicUrl: "..."` 
   - Replace the URL with your romantic music link
   - Save and commit!

## Example:
```javascript
musicUrl: "https://cdn.pixabay.com/music/your-romantic-song.mp3"
```

## Tips:
- Make sure the URL is a direct link to an MP3 file
- Test the link in your browser first - it should start playing/downloading
- Keep the file size reasonable (under 5MB for fast loading)
- The music will loop automatically and play at 50% volume

Enjoy your sweet, romantic background music! 💕🎵
